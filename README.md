# FullCalendarIO
Implementation of Bootstrap and Fullcalendar.IO without a database to see how useful it is.

Not alot to add as it doesn't use anything but a single page and reliance on CDNs. Maybe move these to NPM packages but i really see no point as the project has no bearing other than experimentation.
